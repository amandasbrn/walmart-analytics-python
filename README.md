# walmart-analytics-python

Hello, everyone!
This is Walmart Analytics by me. Through this repository, I aim to showcase my ability in Python, including Exploratory Data Analysis and data visualizations. I also want to answer these questions:

1) Walmart Weekly Sales
2) Fuel Price per Week
3) Temperature per Week
4) The correlations between Weekly Sales and Fuel Price and Temperature
5) Sales on Holiday vs Non Holiday
6) which store has the most sales of all time?
7) Sales Performance on Thanksgiving and Christmas
